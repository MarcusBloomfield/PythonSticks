"name" is the name the player enters when is prompted
"players" is an array that consists of the strings "Player" and  "CPU"
"currentPlayer" holds the string value of whos turn it is
"continutePlaying" is a boolean value that determines when the game ends if the player wants to continue playing
"wins" is a int value that hold how many times the player has won
"losses" is a int value that holds how many time the player has lost


print a welcome message saying "Welcome to nim" to notify the player what they are playing
Use the input(string) function to set "name" to what ever the player inputs

While "continuePlaying" is true we loop
	use the random.Choice function from import random to set the "currentPlayer" to either value from "players"
	declare and set "currentSticks" to [1,3,5,7]
	call the function "DisplaySticks" and pass in "currentSticks" to display the "currentSticks" value to the cmd

		While the sum of currentSticks is greater then 0 we loop
			If the "currentPlayer" is equal to the string value Player
				notify it is the players turn using their name and the print function
			
				declare an int value called "row" and use the GetRow function to set the value
				declare an int value called "stickAmount" and use the GetStickAmount function to set the value
				
				call the TakeStick function and set the "currentSticks" to the update value
	
				Call the printMove function to tell the player their chosen move
				call the function "DisplaySticks" and pass in "currentSticks" to display the "currentSticks" value to the cmd
											
				set the "currentPlayer" to a string of CPU

			Else
				notify the player that it is the cpus turn using the print statement
				 
				declare an int value called "row" and set it to a random value between 0 and 3
				while the array value of the chosen row is 0 we loop
					set the "row" value again to a random value between 0 and 3
			
				declare an int value called "stickAmount" and set it to a random value between 1 and the amount of stick in the chosen row

				call the TakeStick function and set the "currentSticks" to the update value
				Call the printMove Function to tell the player the CPUs move
				call the function "DisplaySticks" and pass in "currentSticks" to display the "currentSticks" value to the cmd

		use the print function to tell the player the game is over 
		if the currentUser is not the player
			tell the player they have won using the print function
			 add one to the "wins" value
		if the ccurrnetser is the player
			tell the player the have lost using the print function
			add one to the "losses" value
		
		Ask the player if they would like to start again using the input function then using the return value set the "continuePlaying" value to false if the player enters any other then yes

DisplaySticks function takes the "currentSticks" parameter
	declare a value named "rowNumber" and set it to 0
	for loop over the "currentSticks" array
		print the row number and the amount of sticks in that array elemet
		add one to the "rowNumber" value
	use print function to display a border

GetRow function takes the "currentSticks" parameter
	declare a value named "row" and set it to zero
	while row is equal to zero loop
	declare a value called rowInput and set it to the players desired value
	If the value is a valid number 
		set the "row" value to the inputed number
	Else
		ask the user to try to enter a correct value
	return the "row" value - 1		

GetStickAmount functions takes the "currentSticks" and "row" parameter
	declare the "stickAmount" value and set it to zero
	While "stickAmount" is equal to zero loop
		declare a value called "stickInput" and set it to the players desired value
		If the entered value is valid 
			set "stickAmount" to "stickInput"
		Else 
			ask the user to try again

	return the "stickAmount" value

TakeSticks functions takes the "currentSticks", "row" and "stickAmount" parameter
	remove the sticks from the selected array element
	return the array

PrintMove functions takes the "player", "row" and "stickAmount" parameter
	display the move of the "player" using a print function and "row" and "stickAmount"
